As part of my [GSoC project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/n6hlc8cT) with [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), I'm working on converting text device tree bindings to YAML Device Tree (DT) Schema. This blog contains the list of bindings converted so far.

## Bindings Converted During the Application Period.

1. [**/ata/fsl,imx-pata.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240320090733.96828-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
2. [**/i2c/nxp,pnx-i2c.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240320084623.82248-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
3. [**/ata/ti,da850-ahci.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240327064354.17384-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
4. [**/crypto/ti,omap-sham.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240327054911.43093-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
5. [**/sound/ti,pcm1681.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240406141454.45529-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)

All of these patches are applied in the [mainline linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?h=v6.10-rc1&qt=grep&q=Animesh+Agarwal). These conversions laid the groundwork for the coding period and helped me in understanding the nuances of the conversion process.

## Bindings Converted During the Coding Period so far.

1. [**/fsl,imx-dma.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240605003356.46458-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
2. [**/sound/asahi-kasei,ak4554.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240607055725.38057-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
3. [**/sound/spdif-receiver.txt**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240611123858.58881-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/): Merged in /sound/linux,spdif.yaml
4. [**/sound/wlf,wm8782.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240612121503.38769-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
5. [**/sound/wlf,wm8804.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240611122258.47406-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
6. [**/sound/realtek,rt5631.yaml#**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240616074936.151267-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
7. [**/sound/realtek,rt5514.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240616095223.260786-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
8. [**/sound/realtek,rt5659.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240624132949.124228-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
9. [**/sound/realtek,rt5677.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240627105030.14360-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)
10. [**/sound/realtek,rt5645.yaml**](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20240702120106.17100-1-animeshagarwal28@gmail.com/)

These bindings were converted as part of the coding phase of the project and are now applied in the linux-next kernel.

## Ongoing Reviews

In addition to the accepted bindings, several bindings are currently under review.

Thank you for following my progress! More updates will be posted as the project advances.
